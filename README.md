DynamicStruct - Tasks from my C++ course at the university

In the task, I needed to create a generic Matrix class.
Then I need to do three tasks with this class
1) In the first task, count the number of columns with zeros.
2) In the second task, the radomes A and B are set separately for each matrix. Their number is calculated and their position in the matrix is underlined.
3) In the third task, the matrix is sorted by the sum of the elements in the columns.
